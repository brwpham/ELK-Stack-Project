## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the YAML file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

  - install-elk.yml
  - filebeat-playbook.yml
  - metricbeat-playbook.yml

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly accessible, in addition to restricting non-authorized traffic to the network.
- What aspect of security do load balancers protect? What is the advantage of a jump box?
	- A load balancer help distribute traffic evenly across multiple servers and mitigate DoS attacks.
	- The advantage of the jump box is that it can manage and update all web VMs within the network instead of manually doing it one by one for each individual device.


Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the logs and system metrics.
- What does Filebeat watch for?
	- Filebeat collects data about the file system, allowing analysts to monitor files for suspicious changes.
- What does Metricbeat record?
	- Metricbeat collects machine metrics for machines within the network. Common metrics include: CPU usage and uptime.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  | 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |
| Web-1    | DVWA     | 10.0.0.5   | Linux            |
| Web-2    | DVWA     | 10.0.0.6   | Linux            |
| ELK      | ElkServer| 10.1.0.4   | Linux            |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jump Box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the our personal IP.

Machines within the network can only be accessed by Jump Box via the Ansible container (IP: 10.0.0.4).

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses  |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes                 | My Personal IP Address|
| Web-1    | No                  | 10.0.0.4              |
| Web-2    | No                  | 10.0.0.4              |
| ELK      | Yes                 | ELK Public IP         |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because it allows us to manage and update configurations for all machines within the same network instead of manually configuring individual devices.


The playbook implements the following tasks:
- Installs Docker onto the ELK VM
- Increases memory value to 262144
- Installs the following services: docker.io, python3-pip, docker (Docker Python pip module)
- After the docker is installed, download and run sepb/elk:761. The container should be started with the following published ports:
	- 5601:5601
	- 9200:9200
	- 5044:5044

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- Web-1 (10.0.0.5)
- Web-2 (10.0.0.6)

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- Filebeat
- Metricbeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- Filebeat collects log files from very specific files, such as those generated by Apache, Microsoft Azure tools, Nginx web server, and MySQL databases.
- Metricbeat collects data regarding metrics such as CPU usage and uptime.

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the configuration file to webserver.
- Update the hosts file to include the IP address of the ELK stack VM.
- Run the playbook, and navigate to the http://your.ELK.VM.IP/app/kibana to check that the installation worked as expected.
